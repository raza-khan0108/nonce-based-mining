# ⛏️ Blockchain Mining Simulation in JavaScript

This project simulates **Proof-of-Work mining** in a basic blockchain using JavaScript and Node.js. It demonstrates how a block is mined by finding a SHA-256 hash that satisfies a specified difficulty level using a nonce.

---

## 📂 File

- `nonceMining.js`: Contains all logic to simulate mining, including block creation, hash calculation, and chain validation.

---

## 🔧 Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or higher)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open a terminal in the project folder
3. Run the following command:

```bash
node nonceMining.js
